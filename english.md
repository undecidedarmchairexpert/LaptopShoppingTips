# Laptop Shopping Tips
---

`Last updated May 16th 2021`

First off, if possible during the pandemic, go look at laptops in person. It's always important to make sure that there are no nitpicky things that you dislike about the machine. In particular, look for the placement of the power/headphone jack, the placement of the power button and the keys of the keyboard. All of these are personal preference things that will vary greatly from machine to machine.

## Where to Shop

The best places to shop are generally from the manufacturers themselves:
- [Dell](Dell.ca)
- [HP](Hp.ca)
- [Lenovo](canada.lenovo.com/)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops)

Otherwise, normal online stores:
- [Amazon](Amazon.ca)
- [Best Buy](Bestbuy.ca)
- [Staples](staples.ca)
- [Costco](costco.ca) (There are things you can buy from their online store without a membership card.)
- [Microsoft](microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops/pc) (Yes! They now have an online PC store.)

### To Avoid
- The Source - Generally their computers are too low end and cheap to be worth it.
- I would also avoid Walmart, for reasons similar to the source.

Note: Both of these generally also have poor after-sale customer service.

## Specifications

### Processor
Both Intel and AMD processors are now just as good as one another. It really makes no difference which company you get as long as it's one of the models listed here.
#### Intel
i5-10*** or more: i7-10***, i5-11***, i7-11***, i5-12*** and etc
This is really all the level of performance you need, even the i5-8* is more than enough today. The 10000-series gen vs 11000-series really makes no difference, don't pay more for a more recent generation.
#### AMD
Ryzen 5 4* or more: Ryzen 5 4***U, 4***HS, Ryzen 7 4***U 5***U, Ryzen 5 5500U and etc
Same thing applies to AMD, as with Intel, their 5000-series wouldn't add a significant amount of performance for daily use, don't pay more for it.
### RAM
8 GB or more is the standard at the moemnt and should be sufficient for regular needs.
### Storage
As long it has an SSD it should be fine. The exact type of SSD will generally not make a difference. For sizing, 128 GB is a bit limited now, but 256 GB should be more than enough.
### Screen
Something with a resolution of 1920x1080 will be really good! Preferably, the screen type should be IPS and not VA or TN (this should be listed in the product specifications), but IPS seems to have become the generalstandard.
### Video Card
A standard laptop really doesn't need anything special, the integrated one will do great.
### Touch Screen
The majority of laptops today will come with a touch screen. It's a nice to have, but in general shouldn't be a must. Don't pay more for one for example.

## Recommendations

### If you're looking for the best value

#### Lenovo Flex 5 (AMD Ryzen 5 4500U)

This model has frquently shown up on Amazon for ~850$CAD, and it actually is a great value in Today's market.

It's by no means the perfect laptop, but it has an ok mix of everything, the screen size it's pretty good, the performance will las you for a few yeaars and it has a pen to use on its touch screen. If you don't want to think too hard about it, and just want a straigh laptop recommendation, pick this option.

### If you want a device with a higher build quality

#### Dell XPS Line

I personally have a Dell XPS (an XPS 15 specifically), they are computers that I've worked with recently (both 13's and 15's) and that several friends and family members have had. I've always been extremely satisfied with the line. The only detail I would add is that both models are now so thin that they only have the little USB ports (USB-C), like the ones on new Android phones. Which means that you might need adapters to connect some devices. The recent refreshes in 2020 to those laptops means that they now have taller 16:10 screens that will look less narrow than your TV. This is useful for productivity as it allows you to see more of a webpagee, document, spreadsheet, code, etc. at once.

#### Microsoft Surface Laptop 4

Microsoft also now have their own line of devices that they've produced themselves and which are amongst the best Windows computers on the market. Their newest laptops are the Surface Laptop 4, which are extremely comparable to the Dell XPS line in terms and quality and are just generally really good. They have a screen that has a different shape (more squarish than wide) which is even more practical for productivity purposes than Dell's 16:10 and comes in both 13" and 15" sizes.. Their keyboards and trackpads are also a joy to use, which is rare for Windows devices.
Their previous device, the Surface laptop 3, is also still a fantastic value if you can find one.

Between both, the Surface laptops usually have a better price for equal performance. I would just say to get the one that's cheapest at purchasing time.

At the opposite end, I would avoid cheaper products, like Acer. They generally are less expensive, but this is reflected in their build quality and their durability. Geneally, the price to quality ratio is just not worth it.

### Gaming or Workstation

If you're looking for a more powerful laptop there is now an acceptable option in terms a value. It will still always be better to get a more powerful desktop and a cheaper laptop, but a middle ground is possible.

The Asus Zephyrus thin-and-light line has recently been refreshed with new parts including the AMD Ryzen 5000 lineup and Nvdia's Ampere laptop cards.

This means that both the Zephyrus G14 (14 in) and G15 (15 in) laptops that come with really decent specifications and make up a stunning walue. They aren't the cheapest, starting at around 1600$, but you definitely get bang for your buck.

This is especially tru if you can find models from last generation at a discount. Even a Ryzen 7 4800HS with an Nvdia 1660ti and 16 GB of RAM is atill really good today, especially if you can find the laptop under 1500$.

You can definitely find cheaper gaming laptops out there, but they'll be less suited for every day use than the Zephyrus. The compromise will generally be a bigger chassis and less battery life. However, they can run from 200$ to 300$ less.

You may be tempted by Dell's XPS 15, which is a fine workstation laptop, but it's thin chassis means it won't cool as well and that it woun't do as well in long running applications like gaming. But it is a perfectly suitable laptop for other workstation purposes.

## Mac

Now, in terms of Mac, as much as they are not my personal preference, at the moment, they can be really good for some people.

The Macbook Air is now a phenominal device! Apple has started doing their own processors and they are exceptional for every day use. They are especially good for battery life and the laptop will last long beyond any of its Intel or AMD counterparts. The compatibility is also really good, so even if its a new processor, you should not have any problems running regular programs on it. The old keyboards, which used to break all the time, are now gone.

The MacBook Pro 13 was also similarly revamped. The bad keyboard has now been replaced with a new version like the one they ship with their desktop and is quite good. The speakers are also pretty good! Probably the best on a 13 in laptop so, all in all, definitely a good upgrade. Because of their larger size, they are able to have cooling that allows the processor to work hard for longer period of time. The performance is not necessarily better, but it will be able to sustain it longer. It also means that they have more space for batteries and it is a laptops that has best-in-class battery life.

If you do only do light usage, get the MacBook Air, if you do some more medium sustained usage or need a very very long battery life, get the MacBook Pro 13in.

I would, however, have some problems recommending a 15 in Macbook Pro. They're called 16 in MBP now, but it's basically the same devicein which they put a bigger screen in. They are still using the old Intel processors, so there are some questions about how long they will be supported.

## Specific to Sales Periods (Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Boxing Day)

In terms of sales tips, it's stupid, just check all the websites early. There are quite a few discounted devices that sell out really quickly. Generally the discounts are the same in store as online, so there's no specific reason to pay a visit. (Except maybe Costco where there's generally different deals online.)
The sales period no longer start the day of, they really go all week now. The day of sales generally has more stuff that is released.
