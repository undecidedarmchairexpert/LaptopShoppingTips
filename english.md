# Laptop Shopping Tips
---

`Last update April 18th 2020`

First off, go look at laptops in person. It's always important to make sure that there are no nitpicky things that you dislike about the machine. In particular, look for the placement of the power/headphone jack, the placement of the power button and the keys of the keyboard. All of these are personal preference things that will vary greatly from machine to machine.

## Where to Shop

The best places to shop are generally from the manufacturers themselves:
- [Dell](Dell.ca)
- [HP](Hp.ca)
- [Lenovo](canada.lenovo.com/)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops)

Otherwise, normal online stores:
- [Amazon](Amazon.ca)
- [Best Buy](Bestbuy.ca)
- [Staples](staples.ca)
- [Costco](costco.ca) (There are things you can buy from their online store without a membership card.)
- [Microsoft](microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops/pc) (Yes! They now have an online PC store.)

### To Avoid
- The Source - Generally their computers are too low end and cheap to be worth it.
- I would also avoid Walmart, for reasons similar to the source.

Note: Both of these generally also have poor after-sale customer service.

## Specifications

### Processor

Intel : i5-8* or more: so i7-8*, i5-9*, i7-9*, i5-10* and etc... This is really all the level of performance you need, even the i5-8* is more than enough today. The 8000-series gen vs 10000-series really makes no difference, don't pay more for a more recent generation.
ou
AMD : Ryzen 5 3* or more:so Ryzen 5 3500U, 3550H, Ryzen 7 3700U, Ryzen 5 4500U and etc... Same thing for Intel also applies to AMD, their 4000-series wouldn't add a significant amount of performance, don't pay more for it.
### RAM
8 GB or more is the standard at the moemnt and should be sufficient for refular needs.
### Storage
As long it has an SSD it should be fine. The exact type of SSD will generally not make a difference. 128 GB is a bit limited now, but 256 GB should be more than enough.
### Screen
Something with a resolution of 1920*1080 will be really good! Preferably, the screen type should be IPS and not VA or TN (this should be listed on the spec sheet), but IPS has become the default standard.
### Video Card
A standard laptop really doesn't need anything special, the integrated one will do great.
### Touch Screen
The majority of laptops today will come with a touch screen. It's a nice to have, but is definitely not required. Don't pay more for one for example.

## Recommendations

I personally have a Dell XPS (an XPS 15 specifically), they are computers that I've worked with recently (both 13's and 15's) and that several friends and family members have had. I've always been extremely satisfied with the line. The only detail I would add is that the new Dell XPS 13's only have the little USB ports (like the ones on new Android phones) which means that you might need adapters to connect some devices.

Microsoft also now have their own line of devices that they've produced themselves and which are amongst the best windows computers on the market. They're newest laptops are the Surface Laptop 3, which are extremely comparable to the Dell XPS line in terms and quality and are just generally really good. They have a screen that has a different shape (more squarish than wide) which is honestly more practical for productivity purposes. Their keyboards and trackpads are also a joy to use, which is rare for Windows devices.

Des deux, le surface est généralement à un meileur prix pour des performances comparables.
Between both, the Surface laptops usually have a better price for equal performance. I would just say to get the one that's cheapest at purchasing time.

At the opposite end, I would avoid Acer product. They generally are less expensive, but this is reflected in their builf quality and their durability. Geneally, the price to quality ratio is just not worth it.

## Mac

Now, in terms of Mac, as much as theur not my personal preference at the momentm they can be really good for some people.

The Macbook Air was just refreshed and is now a phenominal device! The old keyboards, which used to break all the time, are now gone. The components in the computer have finally been upgraded enough to match the minimum specs for this list.
Surtout, le prix est redevenu la barre d'entrée de l'ancien air que tout le monde adorait.
Especially of note is that on top of all of these upgrades, the price has gone back to the original price of the Macbook Air, which means that now, it's really worth it!

Je n'aurais aussi aucun problème a recommender un 15 pouce... (Ils sont appelés 16 mantenant, mais c'est la même chose.) Ils vient de régler à peut-près tous les problèmes qu'y avait avec l'ordi.
I would also have no problem recommending a 15 in Macbook Pro. (They're called 16 in now, but it's basically the same device.) They just refreshed it and fixed pretty much every single problem I had with it. Including the keyboard, as previously mentionned.

Now, the only problem is that they still haven't done this with the 13 in Macbook Pro for some reason. So, it still is plagued by keyboard problems, and has oher annoying gripes. I would steer clear of it for now and get an air instead.

## SSpecific to Sales Periods (Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Boxing Day)

In terms of sales tips, it's stupid, just check all the websites early. There is quite a few rebates that sell out really quickly. Generally the discounts are the same in store as online, so there's no specific reason to pay a visit. (Except maybe Costco where there's generally different deals online.)
The sales period no longer start the day of, they really go all week now. The day of sales generally has more stuff that is released.
