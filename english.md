# Laptop Shopping Tips
---

`Last updated May 27th 2020`

First off, go look at laptops in person. It's always important to make sure that there are no nitpicky things that you dislike about the machine. In particular, look for the placement of the power/headphone jack, the placement of the power button and the keys of the keyboard. All of these are personal preference things that will vary greatly from machine to machine.

## Where to Shop

The best places to shop are generally from the manufacturers themselves:
- [Dell](Dell.ca)
- [HP](Hp.ca)
- [Lenovo](canada.lenovo.com/)
- [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops)

Otherwise, normal online stores:
- [Amazon](Amazon.ca)
- [Best Buy](Bestbuy.ca)
- [Staples](staples.ca)
- [Costco](costco.ca) (There are things you can buy from their online store without a membership card.)
- [Microsoft](microsoft.com/en-ca/store/collections/laptops/pc) (Yes! They now have an online PC store.)

### To Avoid
- The Source - Generally their computers are too low end and cheap to be worth it.
- I would also avoid Walmart, for reasons similar to the source.

Note: Both of these generally also have poor after-sale customer service.

## Specifications

### Processor
Both Intel and AMD processors are now just as good as one another. It really makes no difference which company you get as long as it's one of the models listed here.
#### Intel
i5-8* or more: i7-8*, i5-9*, i7-9*, i5-10* and etc
his is really all the level of performance you need, even the i5-8* is more than enough today. The 8000-series gen vs 10000-series really makes no difference, don't pay more for a more recent generation.
#### AMD
Ryzen 5 3* or more: Ryzen 5 3500U, 3550H, Ryzen 7 3700U, Ryzen 5 4500U and etc
Same thing for Intel also applies to AMD, their 4000-series wouldn't add a significant amount of performance, don't pay more for it.
### RAM
8 GB or more is the standard at the moemnt and should be sufficient for refular needs.
### Storage
As long it has an SSD it should be fine. The exact type of SSD will generally not make a difference. 128 GB is a bit limited now, but 256 GB should be more than enough.
### Screen
Something with a resolution of 1920x1080 will be really good! Preferably, the screen type should be IPS and not VA or TN (this should be listed on the spec sheet), but IPS has become the default standard.
### Video Card
A standard laptop really doesn't need anything special, the integrated one will do great.
### Touch Screen
The majority of laptops today will come with a touch screen. It's a nice to have, but is definitely not required. Don't pay more for one for example.

## Recommendations

I personally have a Dell XPS (an XPS 15 specifically), they are computers that I've worked with recently (both 13's and 15's) and that several friends and family members have had. I've always been extremely satisfied with the line. The only detail I would add is that both models are now so thin that only have the little USB ports (USB-C), like the ones on new Android phones, which means that you might need adapters to connect some devices. The recent refreshes in 2020 to those laptop means that they now have taller 16:10 screens that will look less narrow than your TV. This is useful for productivity as it allows you to see more of a webpagee, document, spreadsheet, code, etc. at once.

Microsoft also now have their own line of devices that they've produced themselves and which are amongst the best windows computers on the market. They're newest laptops are the Surface Laptop 3, which are extremely comparable to the Dell XPS line in terms and quality and are just generally really good. They have a screen that has a different shape (more squarish than wide) which is even more practical for productivity purposes than Dell's 16:10. Their keyboards and trackpads are also a joy to use, which is rare for Windows devices.

Between both, the Surface laptops usually have a better price for equal performance. I would just say to get the one that's cheapest at purchasing time.

At the opposite end, I would avoid cheaper products, like Acer. They generally are less expensive, but this is reflected in their build quality and their durability. Geneally, the price to quality ratio is just not worth it.

### Gaming or Workstation

If you're looking for a more powerful laptop there is now an acceptable option in terms a value. It will still always be better to get a more powerful desktop and a cheaper laptop, but a middle ground is possible.

The Asus Zephyrus thin-and-light line has recently been refreshed with new parts including AMD Ryzen 4000 lineup and Nvdia's Turing laptop cards.

This means that both the Zephyrus G14 (14 in) and G15 (15 in) laptops that come with at least a Ryzen 7 4800HS and a GTX1660Ti with 16GB of RAM make up a stunning walue. They aren't the cheapest, started at around 1600$, but you definitely get bang for your buck.

You may be tempted by Dell's XPS 15, which is a fine workstation laptop, but it's thin chassis means it won't cool as well and that it woun't do as well in long running applications like gaming. But it is a perfectly suitable laptop for other workstation purposes.

## Mac

Now, in terms of Mac, as much as theur not my personal preference at the momentm they can be really good for some people.

The Macbook Air was just refreshed and is now a phenominal device! The old keyboards, which used to break all the time, are now gone. The components in the computer have finally been upgraded enough to match the minimum specs for this list.

I would also have no problem recommending a 15 in Macbook Pro. They're called 16 in MBP now, but it's basically the same device they just put a bigger screen in. They just refreshed it and fixed pretty much every single problem I had with it. Including the keyboard, as previously mentionned, the battery in there is now massive and will last forever and it's finally got a better cooling solution, so it won't burn the laptop instantly.

The MacBook Pro 13 in was also finally revamped, with similar changes to the 16 in. The bad keyboard has now been replaced with a new version like the one they ship with their desktop and is quite good. The only problem is that they didn't bring the changes as far as the new 16 in MBP. The screen size has stayed the same and hasn't increased by an inch. The physical laptop hasn't grown so it still has the same ok battery, but nothing exceptional as the speakers are pretty good! PRobably the best on a 13 in laptop, but they aren't as good as the 16 in. So, all in all, definitely a good upgrade, but nothing exceptional like the 16 in was.

## Specific to Sales Periods (Black Friday, Cyber Monday and Boxing Day)

In terms of sales tips, it's stupid, just check all the websites early. There is quite a few rebates that sell out really quickly. Generally the discounts are the same in store as online, so there's no specific reason to pay a visit. (Except maybe Costco where there's generally different deals online.)
The sales period no longer start the day of, they really go all week now. The day of sales generally has more stuff that is released.
